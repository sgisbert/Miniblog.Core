As the result of years building eLearning apps, we created **Stage Learning**, an online cloud based learning management system, highly configurable and adaptable to the learning needs of business and companies.
   
*Cloud computing*: Stage Learning is a cloud service (<span class="text-warning">SaaS</span>, Software as a Service), so it does not requires any software installation, maintenance or IT department.  
*Scalable*. We support training plans for small groups to thousand users. Also, <span class="text-warning">pay-per-use</span>, guarantees only pay for what you use.    
Developed with <span class="text-warning">ASP.NET MVC 4</span>, it gets a robust and scalable architecture, with several integrated communication tools (forum, calendar, bulletin board, wikis, blogs or polls).    
Optimized with <span class="text-warning">WPO</span> techniques from the beginning of the development, including support for <span class="text-warning">CloudFlare</span> and <span class="text-warning">NewRelic</span>.
