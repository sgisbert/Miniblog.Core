This has been the longest project I've ever worked on, so it covers most of my professional career, which can be divided in three different stages:
<br/><br/>
**2000 - 2002: Multimedia developer**

- At the begining of the project, we were focused on the development of multimedia learning activities with <span class="text-warning">Macromedia Authorware</span>, getting at the end of the project more than 3.000 different learning objects, and close to 7.000 interactive exercises.
 
- All this material is part of the Instituto Cervantes Learning Management System <span class="text-warning">v1.0</span>, "Spanish Virtual Classroom".
  
- At the same time, in order to manage the huge number of activities to develop, we designed an <span class="text-warning">Intranet</span> to arrange the whole development process, which takes care of all the workflow, since the arrival of documents and scripts, until the publishing of the activity, managing all the intermediate tasks and their responsible users. I'm in charge of design, analysis and development of this Intranet.

**2003 - 2008: Lead developer**  

- In this second phase, I take technical responsibility in the project development, during which we address the development of the <span class="text-warning">version 2.0</span> of the Spanish Virtual Classroom, more powerful and complete than the previous version, and including eLearning standards like <span class="text-warning">SCORM</span> or <span class="text-warning">IMS-CP</span>, which allow the project to import and export contents from and to other learning platforms.
  
- At the same time, I take care to professionalize the team development architecture, implanting services like a <span class="text-warning">Version Control System</span> (CVS and then SVN), a <span class="text-warning">Continuous Integration Server</span> (TeamCity), a <span class="text-warning">Bugtracker</span> and a <span class="text-warning">Project Management System</span> with tasks and time tracking.

**2009 - 2011: Lead developer**  

- Once I ended up my <span class="text-warning">Master in software development and web services</span>, in 2008, I decide to apply the new knowledge adquired in the project, so we begun a migration to <span class="text-warning">ASP.Net</span> technology, first to <span class="text-warning">WebForms</span>, during platform v2.0, and finally to <span class="text-warning">MVC 3 y 4</span> for the development of <span class="text-warning">version 3.0</span>, which gets a more solid, scalable architecture than its predecessor, besides the development of a <span class="text-warning">Web API</span> to be able to interact with 3rd party applications.  

- I work designing the <span class="text-warning">web architecture</span> based on MVC model, including design patterns like "<span class="text-warning">Dependency Injection"</span>, with the aim of getting more con el fin de obtener mayor stability, maintenance, solidity and less coupling among developed systems. I also take the task to define the main project development rules, code conventions and workflow methodologies to be used by the team, with the aim of increased productivity and reduce the human errors rate.  

- Finally, with productivity and optimization in mind, I mke the development of a <span class="text-warning">code generation engine</span> based on <span class="text-warning">T4 tempaltes</span> from <span class="text-warning">UML class models</span> in Visual Studio 2010/12/13, which is able to generate the three <span class="text-warning">Backend</span> layers for a defined module (Data access, Business layer and DTO), the <span class="text-warning">SQL stored procedures</span> needed to implement the <span class="text-warning">CRUD</span> model for the model said, and the minimum <span class="text-warning">unit tests</span> to test them.  

- Also, for the <span class="text-warning">Frontend-UI</span> layer, I work to develop several <span class="text-warning">scaffolding</span> templates for MVC 3/4, that can create the <span class="text-warning">MVC</span> (Models, Views and Controllers) layer for a given module, that implements the default <span class="text-warning">CRUD</span> created in the Backend.  

**January 2012 â€“ March 2012: Chief Technology Officer**  

- Finally, I take responsibility for the project management in its last three months of development, with the aim of closing the tasks and send the client all the documents, source code and important information.
