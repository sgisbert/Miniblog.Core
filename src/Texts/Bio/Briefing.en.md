Developer by vocation, father by devotion and amateur chef. I even practice some sport in my spare time, mainly tennis,  and run away to the mountains for skiing whenever I can.  

I enjoy doing things the right way, and get excited with every byte or ms I get cut from websites, applying WPO techniques.  

Currently, Sitecore Architect at Kabel.
